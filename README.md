**Task 1: Reading a File and Handling Errors**

**Problem**: 

Write a Python program that opens and reads a text file (sample.txt), prints its content line by line, and handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.


**Expected Output**

If the file exists: print file content

If the file does not exist:
Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found. Please make sure it exists.


**Task 2: Writing and Appending Data to a File**

**Problem**:

Write a Python program that takes user input, writes it to a file (output.txt), appends additional data, and then displays the final content of the file.



**How to Run the Programs**

Make sure you have Python installed.

Save the code for each task in a file (e.g., Assignment4.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory.

Run the programs using the following commands:

python Assignment4.py
